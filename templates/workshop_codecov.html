    <h1>{{ current_step }}. Set up a coverage tool</h1>
    <p>We also want to keep track of the code coverage of our tests. This way we can keep an eye on sections of code that could be more buggy then others.</p>
    <p>There are various coverage tools available (e.g. codecov, coveralls, codeclimate), but for this workshop the example will use Codecov. If you want to try out another one, feel free :)</p>
    <h2>Sign up on Codecov</h2>
    <p>An account is needed for <a href="https://codecov.io" target="_blank">Codecov.io</a>, but luckily they provide OAuth integration with GitHub, so you don't need to remember yet another username/password combination.</p>
    <h2>Install the Codecov application on your GitHub account</h2>
    <p>This will allow Codecov to not only generate reports, but also post them in a Pull Request that's open, to quickly show if a PR increases or reduces code coverage.</p>
    <p>To do this, you can either navigate to your fork (on which Codecov will suggest to install the app), or go to the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/codecov" target="_blank">GitHub marketplace</a> and install it from there.</p>
    <h2>Enable Codecov for the repository</h2>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's it! Codecov is enabled by default, and will start working the moment it receives a coverage report. This will be done in the next step.</figcaption>
