    <h1 class="mt-5">Workshop</h1>
    <p>The goal of this workshop is to show you how you can setup a CI/CD pipeline. To not make this an overly complex workshop, this exact application which you're now visiting will be used for this purpose.</p>
    <p>The application is a mini-website (built using the Flask micro-framework) programmed in Python. It has only about 400 lines of Python code (excluding tests).</p>
    <p>We'll set up a limited pipeline to make sure that everyone can do this during the workshop duration itself. All the necessary basic principles of the services will be demonstrated, which should allow you to set up a complete pipeline if interested.</p>
    <h2>Used tools</h2>
    <p>We will focus on using "free" (for open-source) tools that can be (easily) integrated into GitHub so that you don't need to bother with setting up local instances.</p>
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is a DVC (Distributed Version Control) service which offers SCM (Source Code Management) using Git. GitHub offers unlimited public repositories for free, and private repositories (albeit with some limitations).</p>
    <p>Some alternatives for GitHub are BitBucket and GitLab. For this workshop GitHub was chosen because it has the largest collection of integrations available.</p>
    <h3>Travis CI</h3>
    <p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis CI</a> is the service which is automatically creating builds of commits/pull requests. Through a webhook/github integration it gets notified of the changes you pushed to GitHub. It reacts upon this by pulling in those changes and performs a set of tasks for you.</p>
    <p>Most of the time this includes creating builds (with multiple OS'es, or programming language versions), running tests, ... It can also trigger a code deployment.</p>
    <p>Alternatives for Travis CI include CircleCI, AppVeyor and Semaphore. On the self-hosted side you can find Jenkins which can fulfill this part.</p>
    <h3>Codecov</h3>
    <p><a href="https://codecov.io/" target="_blank">Codecov</a> is a code quality measurement tool. It generated coverage reports based on the data it receives from test suites that are ran with coverage.</p>
    <p>This enables you to check on how much of your code is covered by unit tests.</p>
    <p>The reporting step in this workshop has been worked out with Codecov, but <a href="https://coveralls.io/" target="_blank">Coveralls</a> or <a href="https://codeclimate.com/" target="_blank">CodeClimate</a> could be used just as well.</p>
    <h3>Heroku</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> offers a PaaS (Platform as a Service), which can be used to run the application on without having to worry about the back-end or underlying platform.</p>
    <p>We will use Heroku to deploy this app onto automatically once the tests pass.</p>
    <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
    <p>If all the tools above are combined and tied together, the next flow can be achieved:</p>
    <p class="text-center"><img alt="pipeline flow" class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/flow.png') }}" /></p>
    <h2>Ready, set, go</h2>
    <p>One last thing before you start: If you can't find the solution, you can request some hints on the page, but if you run out of hints, just ask a question!</p>
